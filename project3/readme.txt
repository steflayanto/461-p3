Compile & run directions:

Directions assume:
1) requirements.txt, p3.py, and p3 are in the same directory as run.sh
2) run.sh is in executable file format (should be by default).

To compile and run:
1) ./run.sh <port_no> 

Note that the above will return an error if 1) the port is reserved or 2) the port is in use. In this case, run it again with a different port. 
On success, will bind and notify listening.
